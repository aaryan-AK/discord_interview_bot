An example is using historical sales data to predict future sales. Unsupervised learning, in contrast, deals with data that has no historical labels. The system is not told the 'right answer.' It must figure out what is being shown. The goal is to explore the structure of the data to find patterns. An example is customer segmentation in marketing."

It’s used as an alternative to rejection points to provide the smallest level of significance at which the null hypothesis would be rejected. A low p-value (typically ≤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis."

It combines the simplicity of decision trees with flexibility, resulting in a vast improvement in accuracy. Random Forests also handle overfitting by averaging or combining the results of different decision trees. This approach is beneficial in complex datasets with high variability or many input features, as it helps in capturing a more accurate picture of the data’s trends and patterns."

In cases where the data is randomly missing, listwise or pairwise deletion can be used. For corrupted data, identifying outliers through statistical tests or visualization methods and deciding whether to remove, adjust, or keep them is critical."

Clustering is an unsupervised learning method used to group a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. It's used in exploratory data analysis to find hidden patterns or grouping in data. Examples include customer segmentation, grouping of documents, or genes with similar expression patterns. Classification, on the other hand, is a supervised learning approach where the outcomes are known and the model is trained with labeled data. The model learns from the training data and then uses this learning to classify new observations."
